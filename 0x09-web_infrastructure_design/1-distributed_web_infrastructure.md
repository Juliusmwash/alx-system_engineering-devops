<h3><h3>Advantages of adding extra servers</h3>
<p><b>Answer to</b> <u>For every additional element, why you are adding it</u></p>
<p>Having a distributed infrastructure with multiple servers offers several advantages over a single server web infrastructure. Here are some key benefits:</p>
<p>(1) <b>High availability</b>: With multiple servers, you can distribute the workload across them and implement redundancy. If one server fails or experiences issues, the load balancer can route traffic to the remaining servers, ensuring your website or application remains available to users. This improves reliability and minimizes downtime.</p>
<p><b>(2) Scalability</b>: Distributed infrastructure allows you to scale your application horizontally by adding more servers. As your traffic and user base grow, you can simply add additional servers to handle the increased load. Load balancers distribute incoming requests evenly across the servers, optimizing resource utilization and ensuring efficient scalability.</p>
<p><b>(3) Improved performance</b>: By distributing the workload across multiple servers, you can handle a larger number of concurrent requests and serve content faster. This reduces response times and improves overall performance for users. Additionally, by placing servers closer to different geographic regions, you can reduce latency and provide a better user experience.</p>
<p><b>(4) Enhanced security</b>: With a distributed infrastructure, you can implement security measures such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and load balancer filters at multiple points in the network. This provides an added layer of protection against cyber threats and improves the overall security posture of your system.</p>
<p><b>(5) Flexibility and fault tolerance</b>: With multiple servers, you have the flexibility to perform maintenance or updates on one server without impacting the availability of your application. Additionally, if a server experiences a hardware failure or other issues, the load balancer can route traffic to the remaining servers, ensuring fault tolerance and uninterrupted service.</p>
<p><b>(6) Load balancing</b>: The load balancer distributes incoming requests across the servers based on predefined algorithms (e.g., round-robin, least connections, etc.). This helps evenly distribute the workload, prevents overload on a single server, and optimizes resource utilization.</p>
<p><b>(7) Easy scaling and resource allocation</b>: When you need to scale your infrastructure further, adding additional servers to the pool is relatively straightforward. Load balancers can automatically detect new servers and include them in the rotation. Similarly, resources such as CPU, memory, and storage can be allocated and balanced across the servers as needed.</p>

<p>A distributed infrastructure with multiple servers and a load balancer provides improved availability, scalability, performance, security, fault tolerance, and flexibility compared to a single server web infrastructure. It allows you to handle larger workloads, better serve your users, and ensure continuous operation even during server failures or maintenance.</p>
