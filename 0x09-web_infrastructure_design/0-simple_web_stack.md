<h3>Client requesting for a website</h3>  
When a web browser receives a URL, from the user, it first checks its local DNS cache to see if it has recently resolved the corresponding IP address(in our case 'www.foobar.com'). This cache stores previously resolved domain-to-IP mappings to improve performance and reduce the need for repeated lookups.  
If the IP address is not found in the local DNS cache, the browser contacts a DNS resolver (typically provided by the Internet Service Provider or a public resolver). The resolver acts as a middleman in the DNS lookup process. The resolver doesn't have the answer but knows how to find it.
