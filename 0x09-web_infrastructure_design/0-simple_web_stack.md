<h3>Client requesting for a website<br>DNS server</h3>

<p>When a web browser receives a URL, from the user, it first checks its <b>local DNS cache</b> to see if it has recently resolved the corresponding <b>IP address</b>(in our case 'www.foobar.com'). This cache stores previously resolved domain-to-IP mappings to improve performance and reduce the need for repeated lookups.</p>
<p>If the IP address is not found in the local DNS cache, the browser contacts a <b>DNS resolver</b> (typically provided by the Internet Service Provider or a public resolver). The resolver acts as a middleman in the DNS lookup process. The resolver doesn't have the answer but knows how to find it.</p>
<p>The resolver starts a recursive DNS lookup process. It begins by contacting the <b>root DNS servers</b>. These servers are the starting point for resolving any domain name. There are a few root DNS servers distributed worldwide, identified by letters from A to M.</p>
<p>The root DNS servers respond to the resolver's query by providing the IP address of the <b>top-level domain (TLD) DNS server</b> responsible for the specific domain extension in the URL. For example, if the domain is "foobar.com," the TLD DNS server for the ".com" domain will be provided.</p>
<p>The resolver now contacts the TLD DNS server and requests the IP address of the <b>authoritative DNS server</b> responsible for the specific domain name ("foobar.com"). The authoritative DNS server is the one that has the final information about the domain's IP address.</p>
<p>The <b>authoritative DNS server</b> responds to the <b>resolver</b> with the IP address associated with the requested domain. It provides the resolver with the necessary mapping of the domain name to the IP address.</p>
<p>The resolver <b>caches</b> the IP address obtained from the authoritative DNS server for a certain period of time (<b>TTL - Time to Live</b>). This caching reduces the need for future DNS lookups for the same domain, improving efficiency. The resolver then provides the IP address to the browser.</p>
<p>Armed with the IP address, the browser can now establish a connection with the web server hosting the requested website. It uses the IP address to initiate a <b>TCP/IP</b> connection, typically over port 80 for HTTP or port 443 for HTTPS.</p>
<p><b>In conclusion</b>, the DNS lookup process involves iterative queries starting from the root DNS servers, going through the TLD DNS server, and finally reaching the authoritative DNS server responsible for the specific domain. The IP address obtained through this process allows the browser to establish a connection with the appropriate web server and retrieve the requested web content.</p>
<h3>Web server</h3>
<p>The <b>web server</b> operates by receiving incoming requests from clients (typically web browsers) over the HTTP or HTTPS protocol. These requests are initiated when a user accesses a website by entering a URL or clicking on a link. Remember the DNS process?</p>
<p>When a request arrives, the web server establishes a TCP/IP connection with the client. This connection is initiated by the client, and the server responds by accepting the connection.</p>
<p>Once the connection is established, the web server parses the incoming request. It examines the request headers, which contain information such as the requested resource (URL), request method (e.g., GET, POST), cookies, and other relevant details.</p>
<p>Based on the requested resource, the web server retrieves the corresponding file or data from its storage or file system. This could include HTML files, CSS stylesheets, JavaScript files, images, or any other resource required to fulfill the client's request.<p>
<p>The web server generates a response based on the requested resource. For example, if the request is for an HTML file, the server may process any server-side code embedded within the file, dynamically generate the HTML content, and combine it with any relevant data.</p>
<p>The web server sets response headers, including the HTTP status code (e.g., 200 for a successful response, 404 for a not found response), content type, caching directives, and other relevant information. These headers provide instructions to the client on how to handle the response.<p>
<p>Once the response is prepared and the headers are set, the web server sends the response back to the client over the established connection. The response typically includes the requested resource, such as an HTML page or an image file.</p>
<p>After sending the response, the web server closes the connection with the client. For HTTP/1.1, the server usually keeps the connection alive (persistent connection) to handle subsequent requests more efficiently. However, for HTTP/1.0 or in some cases, the connection may be closed after each request-response cycle.</p>
<p>Throughout the process, the web server logs relevant information about the request, response, and any errors or exceptions that may occur. These logs can be used for debugging, analysis, and monitoring purposes.</p>
<p>Once the connection is closed, the web server returns to its listening state, waiting for incoming requests from other clients. It continues this cycle of receiving, processing, and responding to requests as long as it's running.</p>
<p><b>Overall</b>, the web server acts as a mediator between clients and the requested resources. It handles incoming requests, retrieves the necessary data, generates a response, and sends it back to the client. The web server's role is to efficiently process these requests, manage connections, and deliver the requested web content to clients.</p>
<h3>Application server/Application files</h3>
<p>In the context of web infrastructure, application files refer to the collection of files that make up an application or website. These files contain the code, scripts, templates, stylesheets, and other resources required for the application to function and produce the desired output. Here's a detailed explanation of application files and their role in a web infrastructure:</p>
<p>The application files typically include the <b>codebase</b> of the web application. This codebase consists of programming files written in languages such as<b> PHP, Python, Ruby, Java, or JavaScript</b>. The codebase defines the logic and behavior of the application, including handling user requests, processing data, performing calculations, interacting with databases, and generating dynamic content.</p>
<p>Many web applications utilize <b>templates</b> to separate the presentation layer from the underlying code. <b>Templates</b> are files that define the structure, layout, and design of the web pages. They often include placeholders or tags that are dynamically populated with data during runtime. Templates are commonly used in web frameworks like Django, Flask, or Ruby on Rails.</p>
<p>Application files may also include <b>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</b> files. CSS is used to define the visual appearance and styling of the web pages. It specifies how elements should be displayed, including fonts, colors, layout, spacing, and other visual properties. Stylesheets ensure a consistent and visually appealing user interface across the application.</p>
<p>Web applications often include <b>JavaScript files</b> that provide client-side interactivity and functionality. These files contain JavaScript code that runs directly in the user's web browser. JavaScript is used to handle user events, manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model), perform asynchronous operations, validate input, and implement dynamic behaviors.</p>
<p>Application files may include <b>configuration files</b> that contain settings and parameters specific to the application. These files allow developers to customize the behavior of the application, such as database connection details, API keys, environment variables, caching settings, and more. Configuration files help in managing the application's behavior across different environments.</p>
<p>Along with code and stylesheets, application files may include other assets such as <b>images</b>, <b>icons</b>, <b>fonts</b>, <b>audio/video files</b>, or any other resources required by the application. These assets are typically stored in specific directories within the application structure and are referenced from the code or templates when needed.</p>
<p>Application files often depend on <b>external libraries</b>, <b>frameworks</b>, or <b>packages</b>. These <b>dependencies</b> provide additional functionality or simplify development by offering pre-built solutions for common tasks. The application files may include references to these libraries or manage them through <b>package managers</b> like <u>npm</u>, <u>Composer</u>, or <u>pip.</u></p>
<p>Managing application files using <b>version control systems</b> like Git or Subversion is a common practice. Version control allows developers to track changes, collaborate, revert to previous versions, and manage codebase branches. It ensures code integrity, facilitates collaboration, and provides a history of modifications made to the application files.</p>
<p><b>In summary</b>, application files encompass the code, templates, stylesheets, configuration files, and assets that collectively define the behavior, presentation, and functionality of a web application. They play a crucial role in delivering the desired user experience and enabling the application to interact with clients, process data, and generate dynamic content.</p>
<h3>Database server</h3>
<p>In the context of web infrastructure, a database server refers to the software application responsible for managing and serving the database. It handles the storage, retrieval, and management of data, providing an interface for applications to interact with the database. Here's an explanation of the role and operations of a database server in the web infrastructure:</p>
<p> A database server is typically powered by a <b>Database Management System (DBMS)</b>, which is specialized software designed to manage databases efficiently. Examples of popular DBMSs include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and MongoDB.</p>
<p>The database server operates on a <b>server-client architecture</b>. The server component, running on a dedicated machine or a cloud-based server, hosts the database management system and manages the storage and retrieval of data. The client component, which can be a web application, desktop application, or any other software, communicates with the database server to access and manipulate data.</p>
<p>To interact with the database server, applications <b>establish a connection</b> using a specific protocol provided by the DBMS. For example, databases like MySQL use the MySQL protocol, while PostgreSQL uses the PostgreSQL protocol. The connection includes authentication credentials to ensure authorized access to the database.</p>
<p>Once the connection is established, the application can send <b>queries</b> to the database server. Queries are typically written using a query language such as SQL (Structured Query Language) for relational databases. The query specifies the desired data retrieval, modification, or manipulation operations. The database server receives the query, processes it, and returns the results back to the application.</p>
<p>Database servers employ <b>query optimization techniques</b> to enhance query performance. When a query is received, the server's query optimizer analyzes the query, evaluates possible execution plans, and determines the most efficient way to retrieve or modify the requested data. This includes evaluating indexes, table joins, and other factors to minimize the query execution time.</p>
<p>
<p>The database server manages the physical <b>storage and retrieval of data</b>. It organizes data into tables, indexes, and other data structures based on the specified database schema. When a query requests data, the database server retrieves the relevant data from the storage and processes it according to the query requirements.</p>
<p>Database servers handle <b>concurrency control</b> to ensure that multiple users or applications can access and modify the database simultaneously without data inconsistency or conflicts. Concurrency control mechanisms, such as locking, transaction isolation levels, and optimistic or pessimistic concurrency control strategies, are implemented to maintain data integrity and consistency.</p>
<p>Database servers provide <b>security features</b> to protect data from unauthorized access. They support authentication mechanisms to verify the identity of clients and enforce access controls based on user privileges and roles. Additional security measures like encryption and data masking can be implemented to safeguard sensitive data stored in the database.</p>
<p>Database servers offer mechanisms for <b>backup and recovery</b> to protect against data loss and ensure business continuity. They provide features for regular data backups, transaction logs, and point-in-time recovery options. These capabilities allow administrators to restore the database to a previous state in case of system failures, accidental deletions, or data corruption.</p>
<p>Database servers include tools and utilities for <b>monitoring and optimizing</b> database performance. They provide metrics and statistics related to query execution time, resource usage, index efficiency, and other performance indicators. Administrators can analyze these metrics to identify bottlenecks, optimize queries, and fine-tune the database server configuration for better performance.</p>
<p><b>In summary</b>, a database server is the software component responsible for managing and serving the database in web infrastructure. It handles query processing, data storage, concurrency control, security, backup and recovery, and performance optimization. It enables applications to interact with the database.</p>
<h3>What is a server?</h3>
<p>A <b>server</b> is a computer or a system that provides services, resources, or functionality to other computers or devices, often referred to as clients. In the context of computer networking and web infrastructure, a server is a specialized computer or software application that receives and responds to requests from clients.</p>
<p>Servers act as <b>service providers</b>, offering specific services or resources to clients. Examples of server types include web servers, file servers, email servers, database servers, DNS servers, and many others.</p>
<p>A server can refer to a <b>physical computer</b> system dedicated to running server software or a virtualized instance running on a shared physical server. In some cases, server functionality can also be provided by <b>software applications</b> running on a client machine.</p>
<p>Servers operate based on the <b>client-server model</b>, where clients request services or resources from servers, and servers respond to those requests. This model enables distributed computing and allows multiple clients to connect and interact with a server simultaneously.</p>
<p>Servers are typically <b>connected to a network</b>, such as a local area network (LAN) or the internet, to facilitate communication with clients. They have a unique IP address or domain name that clients use to locate and connect to the server.</p>
<p>Servers are responsible for <b>hosting and serving</b> content or applications. For example, a web server hosts web pages and serves them to web browsers when requested. Similarly, an email server receives, stores, and delivers emails to clients.</p>
<p>Servers provide various <b>resources and functionalities</b> to clients based on their specific purpose. This can include storing and sharing files, processing and serving web pages, managing databases, providing email services, or performing complex computations.</p>
<p>Servers are designed for <b>reliability and availability</b> to ensure uninterrupted service. They often incorporate redundancy, backup systems, and failover mechanisms to minimize downtime and provide continuous access to clients.</p>
<p>Servers implement <b>security</b> measures to protect against unauthorized access and ensure data confidentiality and integrity. Access controls, encryption, firewalls, and other security mechanisms are employed to safeguard server resources and client data.</p>
<p><b>Server software</b> refers to the specialized software applications or operating systems that run on servers. Examples include Apache HTTP Server, Nginx, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, Linux server distributions, and Windows Server.</p>
