This involved reconfiguring the network settings, restoring database connections, and performing rigorous testing to ensure data consistency. By 11:30 AM EST, all services were fully operational again.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

1. **Database Redundancy**: Implement redundant database connections to ensure uninterrupted service during connectivity disruptions.
2. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Strengthen our monitoring systems to promptly detect and alert on unusual network behavior or database connectivity failures.
3. **Failover Testing**: Regularly conduct failover testing to validate the effectiveness of redundancy mechanisms and recovery procedures.
4. **Network Configuration Audits**: Perform regular audits of network configurations to identify and rectify potential misconfigurations.
5. **Incident Communication Plan**: Develop a robust communication plan to keep stakeholders informed during incidents and provide timely updates.
