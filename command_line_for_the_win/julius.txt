Hello my fellow peers
My full name is Julius Mwangi
I am currently a student at ALX
My biggest goal and dream of my life is to become a software engineer
The best news is that, that is what i am persuing in ALX
The truth is that the journey is tough and needs a lot of commitment and dedication to succeed
Expect failures but don't let them make you fail, learn from them, take them positively, work towards solving them, they are there to show you your areas of weakness...
I believe in my self and i know i will succeed
...
More to come soon
